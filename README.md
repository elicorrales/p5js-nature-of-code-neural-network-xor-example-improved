#This is an improvement on the coding challenge (see link).
I added some UI controls.  Also added one "throw" inside one of the project's methods, so that the error could be captured and explained.
The case is when you try to change the number of output layers to something other than "1", is an error because the training data "target" (expected output) is only a single value matrix, and so the output layer must also be a 1.
